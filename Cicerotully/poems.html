    <h1>1.2 <u>Daughter of Poseidon </u></h1>
    <p>
      <br/>A Licentious girl
      <br/>Maiden of my destiny
      <br/>Filled with propensity for knowledge
      <br/>A talent for corruptibility
      <br/>
      <br/>She will sit
      <br/>Waiting by the corner of the bay
      <br/>Where we always meet
      <br/>A long walk
      <br/>But not too far away
      <br/>
      <br/>And when I'm late...
      <br/>
      <br/>As sesquipedalian
      <br/>She is cleverer than me
      <br/>Driving words deep into the sand
      <br/>Carving with bloodlust
      <br/>Irascible feats in her love lust
      <br/>As she
      <br/>Driven mad
      <br/>Barks with lost magnanimity
      <br/>The fury of her words
      <br/>Set to burn,
      <br/>Warm winds
      <br/>Trace the currents course
      <br/>And she crashes threateningly on the shore
      <br/>
      <br/>And as I hear a storm
      <br/>Brew in her
      <br/>Distrust
      <br/>I'll hurry up
      <br/>
      <br/>Salty
      <br/>Breezy
      <br/>Dust...
      <br/>
      <br/>I'll arrive
      <br/>And until Dusk we can stay there
      <br/>Reading the stars in this mayhem we've created
      <br/>
      <br/>And the rhythm of the sea
      <br/>As the storm clouds gather
      <br/>Mark the balance in our depravity
      <br/>Greyer by greyer
      <br/>By Blacker cloud
      <br/>And I can't breathe
      <br/>Or see the blue
      <br/>In the sky or her eyes
      <br/>
      <br/>A dream or nightmare
      <br/>Never-ending nonetheless
      <br/>
      <br/>We're as immortal as eternity
      <br/>Wiling in the onerous vastness of this moment...
      <br/>
      <br/>As I
      <br/>Take watch
      <br/>In the night
      <br/>Over you
      <br/>Sleeping on the strand
      <br/>Between where dreams and reality
      <br/>Surface at one time
      <br/>And hold hands
      <br/>
      <br/>Where onlookers breathe
      <br/>A free chorus in the drizzle
      <br/>And write us a lease
      <br/>So we don't turn fickle
      <br/>
      <br/>And I don't leave
      <br/>
      <br/>The daughter of Poseidon

  <!--- What She's Worth --->
  <div id="Worth" class="poetry-content">
    <h1>1.1 <u>What She's Worth</u></h1>
    <p>01<br/> To feel unwanted and abandoned
      <br/> To feel that you have been disgraced
      <br/> By the one you'd bear your heart to
      <br/> Whose smile you've written on your face
      <br/>
      02
      <br/> To feel you couldn't bear another
      <br/> Dagger, arrow, sword or spear
      <br/> To want to hide your heart from danger
      <br/> & yet to want to draw her near
      <br/>
      03
      <br/> To feel you need to let her go
      <br/> And to just not have the strength -
      <br/> or will to cast away the sorrows
      <br/> But still, to want not to be helped
      <br/>
      04
      <br/> To wait and not get tired of waiting
      <br/> Although time is slowly running out
      <br/> And to breathe, and hope, and wish for more
      <br/> Than love ever has poured out
      <br/>
      05
      <br/> To learn the discipline of acting -
      <br/> acting fine when you are down
      <br/> And though she gets you weeping more than she makes you smile -
      <br/> to still want to work things out
      <br/>
      06
      <br/> To  learn to speak the language
      <br/> She signals silently to you
      <br/> & to be fluent in every flinch and sigh
      <br/> That her body throws at you
      <br/>
      07
      <br/> To seek to be her greatest friend
      <br/> & her trusted council too
      <br/> To want to be her sentinel -
      <br/> the rock she holds on to
      <br/>
      08
      <br/> & to love her more than comfort
      <br/> Oh, to want to hold her heart
      <br/> To want to counter every blow
      <br/> That sets out to hit its mark
      <br/>
      09
      <br/> To want to wrestle more with fate
      <br/> Than you've ever dared before
      <br/> To risk your heart and soul, your mind
      <br/> Is what she's worth - and more
      <br/>
      10
      <br/> If that's what she is worth to you, at least
      <br/> Well, then she's worth the World
      <br/> If you can stand to let her dig that deep
      <br/> She's your woman, she's your girl.
