        <h2>&#8505;:  What is cicerotully?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>G'morning, g'day, g'afternoon, g'evening &#9788;/&#9789;  &mdash; let's get to the point, shall we:
        </p>
        <p><b>The <tt>cicerotully site</tt> ("tullysite" for short) is the <em>independently coded and maintained</em> semi-professional, semi-satirical personal website of Ephraim Majawala Luwemba (i.e., me &#9835; &#9733;)</b>. I sometimes like to use the moniker 'cicerotully' online, hence my site's name &mdash; it has nothing to do with the Stoic Statesman (<a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/cicero/" target="_blank">unfortunately</a>).
        </p>
        <p><u>I put this site together for two main reasons:</u></p>
        <ol>
          <li>I've been learning the skills for web development and want to polish up said skills. I thought building a website 'the hard way' would be a good way to do this, so all of the things that you see here will be my own HTML, CSS and JS.</li>
          <li> I have a lot of interests and I like to write... After completing a stimulating and quite verbose postgraduate degree, starting work felt a bit like being put on time-out. I'd like to get back to writing  &mdash; and I figure it's never a bad thing to have an outlet for deeper thoughts.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There are a range of things that you'll be able to find on <tt>cicerotully</tt> that may or may not interest you. The general rule I have for content choice is this: if I'm interested in it, I think other people might be interested in it, and I can muster up the energy to write code for the sake of it, 'it' might end up on the website. If not, you probably won't find anything about it here unless it's written by somebody important to me &#9919; (check out my 'friends' page for some of the people I know who I think are cool).</p>
        <p>At the moment, these are the sorts of things I'm planning to / have already put up:</p>
